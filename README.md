# Crowd-Funding-Data-Analysis-Project

Project Overview:

Background:
Crowdfunding platforms have gained significant popularity in recent years, enabling individuals and organizations to fund their projects. However, not all crowdfunding campaigns succeed. The goal of this project was to explore the dataset and identify patterns and trends that contribute to the success or failure of crowdfunding campaigns.

Key Tasks and Achievements:

Outcome Visualization: I used conditional formatting to visually represent campaign outcomes (successful, failed, canceled, or live) in the dataset, making it easier to understand project statuses at a glance.

Percent Funded Calculation: I created a new column called "Percent Funded" to determine how close each campaign was to achieving its initial funding goal. I used conditional formatting to represent this data in a three-color scale.

Average Donation Calculation: I calculated the average donation made by backers for each project and added it as a new column, providing insights into the funding behavior of backers.

Category and Sub-Category Split: I divided the "Category and Sub-Category" column into two separate columns, "Parent Category" and "Sub-Category," to facilitate further analysis by project category.

Pivot Table and Chart: I created a pivot table and a stacked column pivot chart to analyze the success, failure, and cancellation rates per category. The chart allows for easy filtering by country.

Date Conversion: I converted Unix timestamps in the "deadline" and "launched_at" columns into readable date formats, making it easier to analyze campaign timelines.

Outcome Based on Launch Date: I created another pivot table and a line graph to visualize the relationship between campaign launch dates and outcomes, with filters based on parent category and years.

Project Report:

In addition to the data analysis, I prepared a comprehensive report in Microsoft Word that addresses key questions, such as:

Three Conclusions: I drew three actionable conclusions from the dataset regarding crowdfunding campaigns.

Limitations: I discussed the limitations of the dataset, highlighting areas where additional data would be valuable.

Future Analyses: I proposed potential additional tables and graphs that could provide further insights into crowdfunding trends.
